# Carleton University - Bootcamp

## Module 05 Challenge: Third Party APIs

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The Work Scheduler has three different stages; past, current and future. As the days rolls, the color of the time-block will change based on the criteria just mentioned.

<!-- Source Section -->
## Source code
The source code is stored and maintained in Github; https://github.com/gusmiller/Code-Quiz-App. If you are reading this then you already have the URL. It includes additional documents that helped the development of the Code Quiz application. The public application can be found here:

```

```
The code is divided in separate folders:

| Folder Name | Description                                                    |
|------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Main        | This is where the HTML pages are located, license and Readme   |
|             | are stored.
| Documents   | Contain a set of images, original mockup and other information |
| Resource    | Contain different folders to hold CSS, Images and JavaSctipts. |

The latest version is <strong>Version 004</strong>. To visit the application and participate please click <a href="https://gusmiller.github.io/Code-Quiz-App/">Code-Quiz-App</a>

<!-- Business Requirements Section -->
## Business Requirements
The Code Quiz application should welcome the user and offer the option to participate. When user starts the process it will be presented with 5 questions prompted one at the time. Each question answered correctly will earn the user 20 points, but in the other hand if user answers incorrectly then is penalize with 10 seconds. The prompts are as follow:

<ul>
    <li>The internet has been around for more time that you think. Search engines are a very important feature of any browser.<br/> <strong>Which one was the first search engine in internet</strong>",</li>
    <li>An Internet Protocol Version 6 address (IPv6 address) is a numeric label that is used to identify and locate a network interface of a computer<br/><strong>Number of bit used by the IPv6 address</strong>"</li>
    <li>A web browser is an application for accessing websites. The purpose of a web browser is to fetch content from the World Wide Web or from local storage and display it on a user's device<br/><strong>Which one is the first web browser invented in 1990</strong>"</li>
    <li>A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.[1] Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical.<br/><strong>Which of the following programming language is used to create programs like applets?</strong>"</li>
    <li>A computer virus is a type of malware that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own malicious code into those programs.<br/><strong>First computer virus is known as</strong>"</li>
</ul>

# Quiz - Questions layout
The Layout of the Code Quiz is very simple. The index.html has a card styled using CSS and inside this object we have four divisions -Sections, <strong>Introduction Section, Questions Section, Completed Section and Time-out Section</strong>. These sections are hidden with exception of the Introduction which is where the process starts. Once the user starts the Quiz the Questions Section is revealed and timer is started. The questions are stored in an array; therefore we can display the correct question at any given time. 

User will select their choice and application will validate response. Business rules will determine whether user is granted 20 points or timer is reduces in 10 seconds, either way process will move to next question.

Here is the layout of the index.html
<img src="./documents/images/CQC-008.png" height="500">

While in the Questions Section; each time user responds their question it brings next question until last is completed and the <strong>Completed Section</strong> would be displayed. During this process the JavaScript code keeps track of the time. If time runs out, the user's Quiz will be terminated and the <strong>Time-out Section</strong> would be displayed.

<!-- Notes Section -->
## Notes to consider
The Code Quiz Game though it seems pretty simple, it was not. There was a lot of coding behind, plus there was a timer that ended the process, making it very difficult to handle

> **Note**: Parameters required in the process are as follow:
>
> * Validate time has not run out.
>
> * Validate user has completed the process and timer needs to be stopped.
>
> * Calculation of scores; in case it goes negative.
>
> * Option to restart process when Quiz is failed to be handled.
